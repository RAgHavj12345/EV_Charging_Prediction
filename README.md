## 📌 About the Project

The **EV Charging Prediction** project leverages real-world electric vehicle (EV) charging station data to uncover usage patterns, understand energy demand, and build predictive models for smart grid optimization.

As EVs become mainstream, intelligent energy forecasting is key for:

- ⚡ Minimizing grid load
- 🔌 Reducing downtime at charging stations
- 🌱 Supporting sustainable energy planning

This repository focuses on **EDA of Week 1 & 2** data to extract meaningful insights and lay the foundation for future machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- 🔍 Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- 📊 Identify trends in usage across days, hours, and stations
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess raw EV charging data
- 🌐 Understand spatial/temporal energy demand
- 🛠️ Prepare feature sets for model training
- 🔮 Set the stage for demand prediction using ML

### ✅ What’s Next?

Let me know if you'd like:

- A **live preview with Streamlit or Gradio**
- **Interactive graphs** with Plotly
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** for deployment
- A **Dockerfile** for portability

I can help you set those up too.

### ✅ Final Notes:
- Replace `your-username`, `your-profile`, and `your.email@example.com` with your actual info.
- Add any images or visualizations to the `outputs/figures/` folder and optionally link them in the README under an "Examples" or "Gallery" section.

Let me know if you want help creating a `requirements.txt`, `LICENSE`, or `streamlit_app.py` next!
